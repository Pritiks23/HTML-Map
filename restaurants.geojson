// I troubleshoot for like 3 hours but couldn't find out why the features were not showing up in the Map, I tried using the code from lab 6 as a base to try to emulate and used lecture notes. My intention
// was to use an external GEOJSON file to put the feature data in, below is all the data I manually found for this project. Also I added two pluggins to the HTML(geocoder or locate)
// file but I don't know if its showing up correctly.
